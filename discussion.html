        <span class="discussion-container">In the present study, we used the satellite imageries derived through remote
          sensing for acquiring temporal LULC information of Delhi and ESs value coefficients (VCs) of the proximate
          biomes proposed by Costanza et al. The LULC datasets act as proxy measures in valuation of ESs at local or
          regional level, as confirmed by many studie. Though there are arguments from many researchers and economists
          against the utilization of global VC of Costanza et al. for regional value quantification, yet their valuation
          scheme stand lone in this modest field of ESs studies with a comprehensive set of VCs for a range of ecosystem
          types and their respective ecosystem functions . Moreover, this ESs valuation approach assumes spatial
          homogeneity of services within the ecosystems (i.e., LULC types), both at time-series and cross-sectional
          analysis. For instance, either the polluted or non-polluted sites of the Yamuna river received a similar
          estimation, although their ESV could greatly vary, for example in regard of the water provisioning or water
          regulating service. Similarly, the northern tropical thorn forests located on steep slopes of Aravali range
          viz. Asola wildlife sanctuary and the relatively flatter area of Central ridge forests too received similar
          estimation for example in case of protection against soil erosion. These signify that the used ES value
          coefficients do, yet, not consider the impact of environmental quality of a particular LULC type, which
          impacts many key ecosystem functions of urban landscapes like water regulation, flood regulation, soil erosion
          etc. Indeed, such factors also play a key role and should be taken into account in the future development of
          ecosystem value coefficient either with global or regional perspective. This need to be increasingly studied
          in future research initiatives as it will extend our understandings of the spatial heterogeneous
          characteristics of ESVs with changing environmental conditions. </span>

          As urbanization is a universal phenomenon, so as its consequences.
          Over the globe, many studies have talked about the changes in ESs with the spread of human-dominated
          landscape. The growth and development of any built up and exposed area occur at the cost of other
          natural/semi-natural LULC types, namely plantation, forests and cropland, that are capable and efficient in
          providing ESs, hence accounting for human well-being. Many such productive LULC types are lost and affected
          during the process of urban growth in Delhi as well.
          The quantitative results of our study showed the role of LULC dynamics in declining the ESV of the city
          landscape over the course of urbanization.Specifically, our study showed that the fluctuations in estimated
          TESV are a function of the interaction of all changes over the landscape.
          For instance, though the urbanized area was ~25% high in 2003 from 1998, yet TESV was higher for
          2003 (+US$ 1.40 million) due to increased forest cover by 5422.68 ha and hence the associated supporting
          services.Our studies have mirrored the research findings of Wang et al.
          Showing an attributable increase (by US $ 15.86 million) in the provision of ESs with a respective
          increase in forest LULC type in Ningxia of China as a result of forest restoration efforts. Findings from
          other studies also showed how such urban expansions along with a concomitant increase in LULC types holds the
          capacity to deliver a higher level of ESs, and may not lead to
          a net decline in TESV. </span>

      <p class="in-the-present-study-we-used">
        <span class="discussion-container">Similarly, in the second period (2003-2011), our study observed a decline in
          the ESV for the forest and waterbody LULC types while a key increase in ESV (by US $ 1.41 million) for
          plantation class which was a result of 'plant a million trees' - a drive-by Government of Delhi incorporating
          community participation at various scales, hence helped in elevating plantation area of the city by 89% in
          2011 relative to 1998. But overall, expansion of urban and suburban land use holds a greater potential of
          declining the ESs. During the study period, the annual ESs of Delhi were dropped from US$ 30.96 million to US$
          23.52 million.
          The spatially homogeneous per hectare loss was of 24.59% (US$ 5134.5 ha-1 year-1). The most attributable
          reason for this decline is the resultant shift in LULC of forest and cropland into a continuous spread of the
          built-up area, as also seen in other studies.

        <span class="discussion-container">We further assessed the contribution of each ecosystem function over the
          course of the study period. Significant changes have been observed in top ESs of the city. Like, the year 2018
          experienced good monsoons, and hence increased water was discharged from Hathini Kund Barrage flooding the
          flood place area of Yamuna river, which resulted in increased regulatory services, particularly water
          regulation and water supply, for the year. While the prominent decline in nutrient cycling, climate
          regulation, and raw materials ecosystem functions over the study period was majorly consequent of declined
          forest cover (~52%) over the city landscape , who reported the decline in these ecosystem functions of worth
          US $ 7.76 million as a consequent loss of natural forest ecosystem in the Munessa-Shashemene landscape of
          Ethiopian highlands. Theprocess of urbanization in Delhi had consumed a large portion of agricultural land
          reducing the food production function of Indo-Gangetic plain. Similar results were also reported by Zhang et
          al. who showed how the conversion of cropland to built-up area will reduce food production function
          (1.34-3.16%) from 2013 to 2040 urban growth scenario in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, China.
          Findings too revealed a general decline of ESs of associated with cropland by 27.58% related to cropland
          during the course of urban growth in Malda town of West Bengal, India. The vegetation covers over any region
          aids in stabilizing the soil cover, thereby lessening the eroding potential of runoff. The clear-felling of
          trees for developmental activities such as industrialization, constructional activities, etc., has diminished
          of the Delhi city, and henceforth the erosional control function.

        <span class="discussion-container">The district-wise ES assessment assisted in addressing the disproportionate
          distribution of ESs across the city administrative divisions. The results showed how the dominance of South
          and South-central zones of Delhi ridge (in South and South-west districts), the green lung shelter featured as
          the utmost contributors towards city ESV. Further, the forested land converted into conserved sites such as
          the Sanjay Van, Aravalli biodiversity parks and Asola wildlife sanctuary has assisted in sustaining more ESs.
          Additionally, restoration programs of old green patches of the city such as the development of Sundar nursery
          (by 2016) around the archaeological landscape of Delhi contribute in sustaining ESs. Northwest, the largest
          district, is home of about 51% of the rural population of Delhi and hence is largely occupied by agricultural
          land. Further, a part of the Yamuna river channel adds more towards ESs of the district. The presence of
          traversing Yamuna river, with the highest VC, brings out most of ESs of most densely popular districts: the
          Northeast and the East.

      <p class="in-the-present-study-we-used">
        <span class="discussion-container">Over the study period, the creation of Yamuna Biodiversity Park aided in the
          highest net gain (US $ 1.33 million) in ESV of Central district of Delhi through an increase in the floodplain
          forest cover. Next, the West district has also shown a net gain in ESs due to increased forest cover along the
          Yamuna channels. The highest net decline of ESs was faced by the South district. The attributable reason for
          this loss (US$ 3.53 million) is deforestation at the altar of development activities and encroachments. The
          withdrawal of Section 81 of Delhi Land Act (in 2013) in rural districts of Delhi triggered the conversion
          of agricultural land into the construction purposes. The highest built-up expansion (≥double) is experienced
          by Northwest and Southwest districts. Such expansion of built-up area at the cost of agricultural land led to
          the ES loss of about US$ 1 million.

        <span class="discussion-container">In the near future, it is projected that India will be number one
          accommodator of urbanites by adding 404 million new urban dwellers. The present scale and process of
          urbanization in India ensures a greater consequence to the ecosystem functions and processes. As
          rapidly growing cities tend not to sustain their growth, it is necessary to study and highlight the importance
          of ESs in sustaining human well-being by delivering both indirect and direct beneficial services. Such studies
          can be utilized as a powerful means to compare while highlighting the change in ESs with paced up
          urbanization. And last but not the least, such evaluations provide detailed information regarding the economic
          evidence of threats borne by natural ecosystems due to extra-ordinarily rising demand of humans and hence can
          help to create a layman understanding. Such a study is an essential, simple aware but can also assist
          officials engaged in planning policies of existing as well as upcoming urban landscapes with a similar area.
          Hence the policy formulation practices using inputs from ESs relatedm study could aid in protecting the
          natural assets rather than dissipating them.
